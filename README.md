# Portrayal-Catalogue
This focus group was set to review and agree proposed changes to the S-401 Portrayal Catalogue and to record and manage ECDIS Performance requirements. An Issue has been created for each discussion item. Please, in order to have an agile and productive meeting, take time to review and consolidate your organization's position in advance. Comments against each issue will be used to kick off the conversations.
