# Portrayal-Catalogue
This focus group was set to review and agree proposed changes to the S-401 Portrayal Catalogue and to record and manage ECDIS Performance requirements. An Issue has been created for each discussion item. Please, in order to have an agile and productive meeting, take time to review and consolidate your organization's position in advance. Comments against each issue will be used to kick off the conversations.

#001: The folder 'Portrayal-Catalogue' is containing all elements the S-401 shall use with the exemption of the symbols. The hydro symbols needs to be added in the 'Symbols' folder.
#002: The LUA script development shall be done after the comparison of the 'Combined Lookup Tables' and the existing S-101 scripts.
#003: The Portrayal Catalogue XML must be developed manually (based on the S-101 PC)
